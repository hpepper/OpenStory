# Overview

What does this app have to enable me to do?

* Write stories/RPGs
* Play the stories.

## structure breakdown/hieracy for writing

* Series - This is the whole thing a chain of campaigns.
  * Season - This is a campaign about one theme/concept/story.
    * Episode - One session/sitting
      * Encounter - Like: Meet the baron
        * Scene - Smallet part, this could be going through a number of rooms to reach the baron. Each room would be a scene.

### Content

#### Content of Series

* Title
* Concept (text)- loose description of what it is about
* World (drop-down)- Werewolf, vampire, StarWars etc.
  * TODO be able to code the worlds in, since it could help show what challenge rolls to use in the scenes.

## What is needed for admin/configuration

## What is needed for playing the game

## View break down

Top row could have the following drop downs, in the row:

* Series
* Season
* Episode

Each of these break downs will have a second entry called: New
 First entry is empty.

# Thoughts

* How do I handle that some NPC is only for a scene/encounter, some are for an episode, some for a season and a few for the whole series?

* Should this be able to support multiple story tellers?
