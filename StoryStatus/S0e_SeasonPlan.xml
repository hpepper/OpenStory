<!-- Since this is tea-time-tales perhaps one season is like an
ordinary story, the 10-minute movie:
  Exposition/Teaser - Hook the reader[Ray98,85]/[Bel04,24].
  Opening - Leads the main character to a conflict[Tho02,26]/Central question that you'll be exploring throughout the story.
  Incident/Disturbance - Begins the plot/Tell us what the story is.
  Rising/Doorway-1 - This is the event that pushes the Lead from the comfortable daily life, into a new territory.
  Complication - Whatever the problem is, the Hero will attempt to solve it by the EASIEST and most RATIONAL method possible. This beat is about proving the problem can’t be solved by a simple logical method, and is a kind of set up for the complications and obstacles to come.
  Trouble - It’s sort of an “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more” transition[War11].
  Climax - What is the worst possible thing that can happen to my hero?” and MAKING THAT HAPPEN in this section[War11]
  Falling - The Lead faces the ultimate emotional challenge. When all seems lost[War11]. This is when the Lead says: "Enough! I can't stand this anymore. I need to resolve this problem."[Kea98,84]
  Prepare - Presents the Answer to the Dramatic Question[War11]. (Posed in: Rising)
  Resolution/Closure - Ends the conflict. Leaves the reader satisfied/Resolution to the problem starts.Write what the resolution is/[Ray98,88]/[Bel04,25].
  End-credits -
  TODO V try to do that with the Season plan below.

    <!-- STEP - 2 - List/look at what is possible in the premise, p20
      Explore your options.
      The intent here is to brainstorm the many different paths the idea can take
       and then to choose the best one.
      Some ideas generate certain expectations, things that must happen to
       satisfy the audience if this idea were to play out in a full story.
      Ask yourself, "What if ... ?"
      What is allowed in the story world and what is not.
      Don't censor or judge yourself.
      What if the crime just keeps getting bigger?

    <!-- Step - 4 - Your overall story strategy, stated in one line,
       is the designing principle of your story. p24
      The designing principle helps you extend the premis into deep structure.
  
      Design principles are fundamental pieces of advice for you to remember
       what the intent with the story is. 
  
      By having this the design principle available it can be references 
        every time you need to make decissions about your story.

      There should be one action that is most important,

       That action is the cause-and-effect path.
  
      If you are developing a premise with many main characters, each story line
       must have a single cause-and-effect-path.
      And all the story lines should come together to form a larger,
       all-encompassing spine.

    <!-- Step - 8 - Determine your hero's possible character change, p31
    Character change is what your hero experiences by going through the struggle.

    The change can be either positive or negative.
    How does the act of struggling to do the basic action lead the character overcome the weakness and get to the change.
    A character with certain weaknesses, when being put through the wringer of a particular struggle,
    is forged and tempered into a changed being.

    The basic action should be the one action best able to force the character to deal with the weakness and change.

    Write down a number of possible optional for the heroine's weaknesses and change.

    The weakness should be both psychological and moral.

    <!-- Step 9 - Figure out the hero's possible moral choice, p34

    make sure that it is a difficult but plausible choice

    The central theme of a story is often crystallized by a moral choice the hero must make,
     typically near the end of the story.
     Theme is your view of the proper way to act in the world.
     It is your moral vision, and it is one of the main reasons you are writing your story.
     Theme is best expressed through the structure of the story, through what I call the moral argument.
     This is where you, the author, make a case for how to live,
       not through philosophical argument,
       but through the actions of characters going after a goal.
    Probably the most important step in that argument is the final moral choice you give your heroine.

    To be a true choice, your heroine must either:
      select one of two positive outcomes
      or, avoid one of two negative outcomes.

      Make the optionas as equal as possible, with one seeming only slightly better than the other.

    <!-- Step - 10 - Gauge the audience appeal, p35
    Ask yourself: Is this single story line unique enough to interest a lot of people besides me?

    Always try to write something that you care about and also think will appeal to an audience.
