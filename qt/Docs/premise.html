        Premise - an idea or theory on which a statement or action is based.
?[It is your story stated in one sentence]
?[It is the simplest combination of character and plot, and typically consists of some event that starts the action, some sense of the main character and some sense of he oucome of the story.]

It is the most important bits?

This seems similar to Vickis Slog line, except the slogline is a teaser, this premise reveals the ending.

So it seems like the 'premise' is the essense of the story in one line.
How can you start with that?

Maybe I should start with: 
* idea
* or, concept

From: https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/premise
 When you called 911 on the guy in your back yard, it was on the premise that he was a thief and not the meter-reader.
 a statement that is assumed to be true and from which a conclusion can be drawn

A premise is something that you suppose is true and that you use as a basis for developing an idea.


CONCEPT: sum up the whole story in a single line.
